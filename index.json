It\u0026rsquo;s really great introduction to xenobiology. I recommend to read it. PDF\nXenobiology studies life with alternate way to get energy.\nInformation =\u0026gt; DNA -\u0026gt; Protein Form =\u0026gt; Life as series of innate patterns Metabolism \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Information =\u0026gt; Life as process of chemical transformation of substances Information \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Form =\u0026gt; Life as flow of information Energy\u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Form =\u0026gt; Life as energy flow Metabolism \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Energy =\u0026gt; Life as thermodynamic and kinetic process Xenobiology can provide potential medical and biosafety applications, as well as challenge the foundations of biological engineering. This paper reviews the philosophical aspect of xenobiology, focusing on the possible multiple realizability of life.\nSynthetic philosophical theories aim to design systems with natural functions, rather than biological functions, to test chemistry and understand life.\n","permalink":"https://youshitsune.me/posts/could-we-really-be-made-of-swiss-cheese/","title":"Could We Really Be Made of Swiss Cheese?"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Attention is all you need\u0026rdquo; is a research paper that proposes a new way of making an AI.\nAttention is mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, all of which are vectors: the query, the keys, and the values. The results are calculated as a weighted sum of the values, ith each value\u0026rsquo;s weight determined by the query\u0026rsquo;s compatibility function with its corresponding key.\nThere are to type of attentions:\nSelf-attention Cross-attention A word about cross-attention is gonna be some other time.\nSelf-attention is mechanism that links various positions in a single sequence to create a representation of the sequence. Reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and the acquisition of task-independent phrase representation are just a few of the activities in which self-attention has been successfully applied.\nMore about this you can read in \u0026ldquo;Attention is all you need\u0026rdquo;. Here is PDF of it.\n","permalink":"https://youshitsune.me/posts/attention-is-all-you-need/","title":"Attention is all you need"},{"content":"Basically, there is idea for engine: Dark Matter engine uses Dark Matter particles annihilation remnants as propulsion.\nBasically, you can have a engine in shape of cube, then you have a high pressure on it. Then just remove one side of cube, place where remnants can exit. Which in result propels the cube.\nMore about this is written in this paper by Jia Liu.
