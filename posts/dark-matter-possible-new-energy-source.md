# Dark Matter possible new energy source
Basically, there is idea for engine: Dark Matter engine uses Dark Matter particles annihilation remnants as propulsion.

Basically, you can have a engine in shape of cube, then you have a high pressure on it. Then just remove one side of cube, place where remnants can exit. Which in result propels the cube.

More about this is written in this paper by Jia Liu.
