# Flashing custom ROM
I always wanted to flash custom rom on my phone, but there isn't any offical software for it.

So, I started to search for best unoffical options.

I've found Lineage OS 20 and TWRP.

### First try
When, I first tried I used heimdall. And soft-bricked my phone.

### Second try
Then, I found leaked version of odin for linux. I've flashed everything, and then lineage os was stuck at boot.

### Third try
Oh, I forgot to flash multidisable, when I flashed it and it worked perfectly.

I'm very excited that I finally completed my wish of using custom room.

If anyone is flashing for same device, message me if you want files for flashing.
