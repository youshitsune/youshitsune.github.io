# Going step closer to Full Suckless
Today, I was scrolling through suckless rocks page, as every other suckless user. And I saw section for shells, installed yash shell.

I have to admit this is one of the best shells I used. It has functionality like fish shell, but script syntax like bash. Which I really love.

So, that's it. I'm one step closer to Full Suckless.
