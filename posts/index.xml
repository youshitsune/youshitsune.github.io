            <description>Today, I was scrolling through suckless rocks page, as every other suckless user. And I saw section for shells, installed yash shell.
I have to admit this is one of the best shells I used. It has functionality like fish shell, but script syntax like bash. Which I really love.
So, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;m one step closer to Full Suckless.</description>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built my own currency system, which you can access at https://rad.youshitsune.tech.
It&amp;rsquo;s open-source, everything is open-source except database.
It&amp;rsquo;s open for registration, if you want some of it just send me mail with title &amp;ldquo;Want Radiana&amp;rdquo;.</description>

            <description>If you are lover of privacy like I am, you&amp;rsquo;ll love this configuration.
TOR Firstly, you need to start tor.
sudo systemctl start tor Then add proxy with this command
/proxy add tor socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 If you want to setup when you connect to any irc server to use proxy, execute this command
/set irc.server_default.proxy &amp;#34;tor&amp;#34; But, if you want for specific server run this
/set irc.server.server_name.proxy &amp;#34;tor&amp;#34; Of course you should change server_name with server name.</description>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve researched on some ways to be productive(i.e. wasting my damn time). And I completely overlooked the calendar.
Now you should manage your time in blocks. That means for every task you block a time in calendar. One that works for me is Google Calendar, yes I know Google! But I can&amp;rsquo;t found reliable alternative if you&amp;rsquo;ve some alternative mail me.
With this method I know at what time I supposed to do something.</description>

<p>Now you should manage your time in blocks. That means for every task you block a time in calendar. One that works for me is Google Calendar, yes I know Google! But I can&rsquo;t found reliable alternative if you&rsquo;ve some alternative <a href="mailto:youshitsune@envs.net">mail me</a>.</p>
<p>With this method I know at what time I supposed to do something. It&rsquo;s that easy, don&rsquo;t ever listen to some productivity guru, who tells you he manages his whole life in Notion or some fancy apps like that. Being productive is easy, you just need to have a strong will to do things that you actually don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>So, just use calendar it made me very productive.</p>

            <description>&amp;ldquo;Could we really be made of Swiss cheese?&amp;rdquo; is paper that explains xenobiology. It&amp;rsquo;s really great introduction to xenobiology. I recommend to read it. PDF
Xenobiology studies life with alternate way to get energy.
Information =&amp;gt; DNA -&amp;gt; Protein Form =&amp;gt; Life as series of innate patterns Metabolism &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Information =&amp;gt; Life as process of chemical transformation of substances Information &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Form =&amp;gt; Life as flow of information Energy&amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Form =&amp;gt; Life as energy flow Metabolism &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Energy =&amp;gt; Life as thermodynamic and kinetic process Xenobiology can provide potential medical and biosafety applications, as well as challenge the foundations of biological engineering.</description>

<li>Information =&gt; DNA -&gt; Protein</li>

<p>Xenobiology can provide potential medical and biosafety applications, as well as challenge the foundations of biological engineering. This paper reviews the philosophical aspect of xenobiology, focusing on the possible multiple realizability of life.</p>
<p>Synthetic philosophical theories aim to design systems with natural functions, rather than biological functions, to test chemistry and understand life.</p>

            <description>&amp;ldquo;Attention is all you need&amp;rdquo; is a research paper that proposes a new way of making an AI.
Attention is mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, all of which are vectors: the query, the keys, and the values. The results are calculated as a weighted sum of the values, ith each value&amp;rsquo;s weight determined by the query&amp;rsquo;s compatibility function with its corresponding key.
There are to type of attentions:</description>

The results are calculated as a weighted sum of the values, ith each value&rsquo;s weight determined by the query&rsquo;s compatibility function with its corresponding key.</p>
<p>There are to type of attentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-attention</li>
<li>Cross-attention</li>
</ul>
<p>A word about cross-attention is gonna be some other time.</p>
<p>Self-attention is mechanism that links various positions in a single sequence to create a representation of the sequence.
Reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and the acquisition of task-independent phrase representation are just a few of the activities in which self-attention has been successfully applied.</p>
<p>More about this you can read in &ldquo;Attention is all you need&rdquo;. Here is <a href="https://youshitsune.me/pdf/Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf">PDF</a> of it.</p>

            <description>Basically, there is idea for engine: Dark Matter engine uses Dark Matter particles annihilation remnants as propulsion.
Basically, you can have a engine in shape of cube, then you have a high pressure on it. Then just remove one side of cube, place where remnants can exit. Which in result propels the cube.
More about this is written in this paper by Jia Liu. PDF</description>
