      <description>I hope this is my final settle, I switched from Simplenote to Logseq. I switched from it beacuse of it&amp;rsquo;s minimal features. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have formating, for example. But, my main reason was that i cant really organise my notes with tags. I like to link them. So that&amp;rsquo;s where Logseq comes in play, I love Obsidian (but it&amp;rsquo;s not open-source, for those who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know). So I was happy when I found out about Logseq, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice note-taking app.</description>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about that I want to switch to note-taking app like Obsidian and that it&amp;rsquo;s open-source.
I finnaly settled on SimpleNote for it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity. I watched video from Tiego Forte which was really good, I recommend it to anyone who wants to find his note-taking app.</description>

      <title>Finding Open Source Note Taking</title>

      <description>Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m using Obsidian as my note taking app. But, there is only one problem with it and that problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s not open-source. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very concerning, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t use Obsidian Sync feature and save your notes on HDD.
Today, I searched for open-source note taking app like Obsidian. I only found LogSeq which is really great app, but it&amp;rsquo;s not for me really. I like simplicity of Obsidian and when I use LogSeq I really feel that it&amp;rsquo;s cluttered.</description>
