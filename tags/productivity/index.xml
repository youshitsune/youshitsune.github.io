      <description>I hope this is my final settle, I switched from Simplenote to Logseq. I switched from it beacuse of it’s minimal features. It doesn’t have formating, for example. But, my main reason was that i cant really organise my notes with tags. I like to link them. So that’s where Logseq comes in play, I love Obsidian (but it’s not open-source, for those who doesn’t know). So I was happy when I found out about Logseq, it’s really nice note-taking app.</description>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about that I want to switch to note-taking app like Obsidian and that it’s open-source.
I finnaly settled on SimpleNote for it’s simplicity. I watched video from Tiego Forte which was really good, I recommend it to anyone who wants to find his note-taking app.</description>

      <title>Finding Open Source Note Taking</title>

      <description>Right now, I’m using Obsidian as my note taking app. But, there is only one problem with it and that problem is that it’s not open-source. This shouldn’t be very concerning, because if you don’t use Obsidian Sync feature and save your notes on HDD.
Today, I searched for open-source note taking app like Obsidian. I only found LogSeq which is really great app, but it’s not for me really. I like simplicity of Obsidian and when I use LogSeq I really feel that it’s cluttered.</description>
